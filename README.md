Jackalson Enterprise's journey.
I want to become a successful individual software developer and build up my skills to a proffessional level. My dream company name is **Jackalson Enterprise**. Previously I worked on drag and drop functionality using a bit code editor. However, I realised the importance of learning to code and have enrolled in the **Umuzi** bootcamp to become a skilled developer. Here are a few apps I created using drag and drop:

-[HA Tunnel Files](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pimpa.drbetcodes)
